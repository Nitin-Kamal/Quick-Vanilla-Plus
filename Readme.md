Quick Vanilla+ is the ultimate Minecraft modpack for players seeking top-notch performance enhancements and quality of life improvements. With a focus on maximizing FPS, this pack integrates the finest optimization mods available, ensuring smooth gameplay even on lower-end systems. Harnessing the power of Fabric Modloader, Quick Vanilla+ delivers an unparalleled experience, surpassing even Optifine in its suite of enhancements. Not only does it focus on optimizations, it also focuses on reducing the stress on your computer so that you can multitask with ease. Say goodbye to lag and hello to seamless gameplay with this meticulously crafted modpack. Explore your world with ease, build to your heart's content, and enjoy every moment with Quick Vanilla+.

Enjoy the optimizations in multiplayer too as the modpack is also compatible with vanilla server.(Note that for some mods like worldedit to function in servers, the server also needs to have the worldedit plugin installed. But you will be able to join and play in servers, just without the advantage of worledit.)

Some of the significant quality-of-life features provided:
Optifine shader support.
Almost all of the settings in the optifine video settings page.
Optifine animated textures support.
Optifine custom entity textures support.
Pin almost every data from the F3 menu onto your screen.
Minimap and worldmap.

And much more!
